# ElementalMatter
The main repository for Elemental Matter project.

The main branch is for release builds, so make sure to do your changes on dev,
after the base game is finished, if you go ahead and make large changes, 
create a branch based from dev.

Each release on master there will be a release generated meaning for those that
don't use git, you can just pull a zip, which will contain the compiled binaries
of the project.

This branch is for the models, the models are placed in their respective folders,
move them through the folders for each stage.

Modeling -> Modeled -> Texturing -> Finished
